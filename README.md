#### Have you ever needed to find a specific part in a very long Youtube video? And you had to do so by seeking that part manually, I had the same problem, so I built this simple website in one day to automate this process.

You simply need to enter the youtube video url and the keyword you're searching for, and you'll find a list of the times that keyword was mentioned, then you can easily jump to those segments without wasting any time.

You can view the website here: https://afternoon-spire-69649.herokuapp.com/.
